# HTMVis
Hierarchical Temporal Memory visualizations with [Godot engine](https://godotengine.org/).

This is a supplementary project for [HIMA](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/him-agent).

### Instruction

At the start, path to the tm data folder containing `project_info.json` and `stream` folder should be specifyed.
`stream` should contain json files (chunks) representing snapshots of cell and segment states:

```
data
│   project_info.json
│
└───stream
        project_[steps].json
        ...
        project_[steps].json
```

Vizualizer loads new files created in `stream` folder on the fly.

Current version supports data generated by [this](https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/him-agent/blob/47fa3e38643429bf5c325c468933646098e994d6/hima/modules/htm/tm_writer.py) class.
Any other class that generates json files in the same fomat should also work.

**Controls**:
- `Right/Left arrow` -- next/previous state 
- `A`, `S`, `D`, `W` -- camera movement
- `Mouse wheel` -- camera zoom
- `P` -- change data path

Click cell to see information and browse segments. Select segment to see its receptive field.
